# Week_5_MidtermProject

Members of the group: Maria Amaral, Joana Hoang (Team MCJ)

Project: 
As Team MCJ we are curious and wanted to investigate how far we are at this point in time when it comes to the question of sustainable energy. 
Are we already well on our way or is there still a long way to go regarding sustainable energy? We are trying to identify correlations using additional data such as excerpts from the Paris Agreement, country types and income classes. Through these insights, we will use machine learning to do predictions for our investors. These in turn will then be helpful to them for their investments in the countries. 

The Team MCJ will provide these insight in a story while using Tableau.

## Goal of the project, is to guide investors towards sustainable energy opportunities in investment strategies.
