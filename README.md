# Week_5_MidtermProject

Members of the group: Maria Amaral, Joana Hoang (Team MCJ)

Project: 
As Team MCJ we are curious and wanted to investigate how far we are at this point in time when it comes to the question of sustainable energy. 
Are we already well on our way or is there still a long way to go regarding sustainable energy? We are trying to identify correlations using additional data such as excerpts from the Paris Agreement, country types and income classes. Through these insights, we will use machine learning to do predictions for our investors. These in turn will then be helpful to them for their investments in the countries. 

The Team MCJ will provide these insight in a story while using Tableau.

## Goal of the project, is to guide investors towards sustainable energy opportunities in investment strategies.

Certainly! Based on your description, I can provide a tentative timetable for your project:

**Monday (Day 1): Data Understanding & Cleaning**

---> PRESENTATION PITCH

  1. **Dataset Familiarization**: Everyone should get a quick overview of the dataset.
  2. **Define the Scope**: Discuss as a group to decide which specific questions or themes you want to address.
  3. **Data Cleaning & Pre-processing**: Using SQL or Python (like pandas), clean the data. Look for missing values, outliers, duplicate rows, and correct data types.
  4. **Data Validation**: After cleaning, validate a sample to ensure the accuracy of your cleaning process.

**Tuesday (Day 2): Data Exploration & Visualization Drafting**

  1. **Data Exploration**: Dive deep into the data using both statistical methods and visual tools to understand the distribution and relationships of the variables.
  2. **Sketch Visualization Ideas**: Create rough sketches of the types of visualizations that will most effectively communicate your insights.
  3. **Begin Visualization**: Start creating the visualizations in Tableau based on your sketches.

**Wednesday (Day 3): Finalize Visualization & Reporting**

  1. **Improve and Finalize Visualizations**: Based on the feedback from Day 2, refine and finalize your visualizations in Tableau.
  2. **Start Report Draft** : Begin drafting the insights and findings.
  3. **Complete the Report** : Ensure the report is structured, easy to read, and effectively communicates your findings to the target audience.
  4. **Initial Review** :Ensure the visualizations and the report are aligned. 

**Thursday (Day 4): Review, Debugging, and Final Touches**

  1. **Final Review** : Split into pairs and review each other's work. This can help identify any gaps, errors, or areas of improvement.
  2. **Debugging and Final Adjustments**: Fix any issues that came up during the review.
  3. **Prepare presentation**
